# Very Deep Learning Course

This repository contains the programming tasks for the Very Deep Learning course at RPTU-KL (Winter Semester 2022/23), taught by [Dr. Muhammad Zeshan Afzal](https://av.dfki.de/members/afzal/). The course is based on the [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

The official course website can be found on [OLAT](https://olat.vcrp.de/auth/RepositoryEntry/3904897313).

## Exercises

The exercises and solutions can be found in the `exercises` folder. The exercises are written in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). You can either download the notebooks and run them locally or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run them in the cloud.

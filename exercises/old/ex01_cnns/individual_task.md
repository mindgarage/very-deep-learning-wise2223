# 3. Individual Practical Task

This practical task will be a longer work carried out throughout the whole semester. In the first two weeks you should think about a practical problem you would like to tackle with Deep Learning technologies. Later, you will develop a baseline system and then apply better and more advanced methods throughout the semester. You should have at least three individual meetings with Marcus and Michele where you discuss about your task and ideas throughout the semester.

The first meeting should be within the next three weeks. So setup a meeting with Marcus and Michele between the 18th and 20th of October (We will provide you with timeslots beforehand).
